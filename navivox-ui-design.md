# Navivox UI Design Guide

Status: planning draft
Updated: 2026-05-16
Source: current HTTP/WebSocket gateway plan, PRD, and app shell

## 1. Design Principles

1. **Connect and talk first**: the first useful path is base URL, token, health
   check, stream, chat.
2. **Work-focused, not marketing**: no landing page before the operator can talk
   to a Gormes profile.
3. **Tool calls are first-class UI**: use structured cards, not transcript log
   dumps.
4. **Secrets are invisible by design**: write-only fields, redacted status, no
   read-back.
5. **Server-authoritative config**: the app edits drafts; Gormes validates and
   applies.
6. **Voice is an input mode, not a setup blocker**: text turn fallback always
   works.
7. **Trust boundaries stay visible**: connected host, auth mode, exposure mode,
   and token-required state are shown without leaking secrets.
8. **Dense, adaptive layout**: mobile keeps chat immersive with a
   Telegram-style navigation drawer for top-level destinations; desktop uses a
   left rail and status bar.
9. **Telegram-inspired, Gormes-owned**: borrow fast scanning, grouped bubbles,
   status ticks, action sheets, and compact navigation from Telegram-like apps,
   but keep Navivox focused on Gormes profiles, tools, voice transcripts, and
   safe config.
10. **Profiles are contacts**: the chat list represents `server + profile_id`
    contacts. A profile is an isolated Gormes home, not a live concurrent agent
    router.
11. **Local voice commands stay local**: the command word, calibration, aliases,
    pins, server trust, and voice switching are Navivox app settings; Gormes
    remains authoritative for profile/config/workspace state.

## 2. Primary Screens

### 2.1 Launch Routing

- No saved or trusted server: open setup.
- One healthy saved server and usable profile: open that profile chat.
- Multiple servers, offline/auth issue, or pending attention: open the profile
  contact list.

### 2.2 Profile Contact List

+------------------------------------------------+
```

Chat list rows are profile contacts:

- Stable identity: `server_id + profile_id`.
- Deterministic generated avatar from `server_id + profile_id`.
- Server label as a small chip.
- Server-authoritative display name, with canonical profile id in details.
- Sanitized latest preview from the server.
- Timestamp.
- Health chips for config/provider/model/memory/gateway/WS.
- Attention count for approvals, failed tools, auth, offline server, workspace
  issues, or active/stuck turns.
- Compact workspace summary such as `2 roots` or `workspace issue`, never raw
  paths.
- Row tap opens the current/latest session for the profile.
- Row mic opens continuous voice when the server is trusted and healthy.
- Long press opens profile details/edit.
- Floating add button opens an action sheet with New profile, Add server, and
  Import connect-info.

The list is flat by default. Pinned contacts sort first locally, but pins never
change command routing.

### 2.3 Setup Screen

- Health failed: show gateway unavailable and retry.
- Unauthorized: show token/auth action.
- Exposure blocked: show server-side exposure guidance.
- Connected: navigate to chat.

### 2.4 Chat Screen

```text

```

Key UI elements:

- Server label opens server switcher.
- Profile pill opens profile switcher.
- Status chip shows connected, reconnecting, offline, unauthorized, or blocked.
- User messages are right-aligned.
- Assistant messages are left-aligned.
- Streaming assistant text updates in place.
- `ToolCallCard` appears inline as a distinct execution card with status,
  approvals, and expandable details.
- Voice button starts continuous voice for the active profile when allowed.
- Long press opens a message action sheet: copy, retry, inspect event, reveal
  redacted fields when authorized.
- The plus button opens the action tray for profile seed, tool approvals,
  profile config, workspace roots, and future attachments.
- Composer text that exactly matches a command-word command, such as
  `navi mineru`, is handled locally by Navivox and is not sent to Gormes.

### 2.5 Continuous Voice

```text
+------------------------------------------------+
| Voice: Mineru Builder       local-gormes   OK  |
+------------------------------------------------+
| Listening                                      |
| Command word: Navi                             |
|                                                |
| user bubble: checking server status            |
| Sending...                               cancel |
|                                                |
| [command] [stop]                               |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

Command mode:

```text
+------------------------------------------------+
| Command mode                              0:05 |
+------------------------------------------------+
| Say a profile name, stop, cancel, settings,    |
| or help.                                       |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

Voice rules:

- Continuous voice is a global app mode with one active target profile.
- Row mic starts listening immediately after mic permission and per-server
  local trust exist.
- Device speech-to-text streams into the active profile as a voice-marked user
  bubble.
- Auto-send is the default, with a short visible `Sending...` grace window.
- The command word defaults to `navi` and can be changed locally.
- Optional calibration asks the user to say the command word three times; reset
  is available in Settings.
- Command word detection only works at the beginning of an utterance and only
  while Navivox voice mode is active.
- Saying the command word alone enters local command mode for about five
  seconds.
- Direct commands also work: `navi mineru`, `navi cancel`, `navi stop`,
  `navi settings`, `navi help`.
- Command-mode speech is discarded on timeout and is never sent to Gormes.
- Profile commands match the app's known flat `server + profile` contact list;
  exact normalized unique matches switch immediately, duplicates show
  disambiguation.
- Voice profile switching is a global app setting. If disabled, command-word
  profile switches are ignored and treated as normal dictation only when they
  are not recognized as local commands.
- `navi cancel` cancels the current cancellable voice turn. Before server
  commit it can discard/delete; after server commit it marks cancelled/stopped
  and never pretends tool side effects were undone.
- `navi settings` opens local Navivox settings, not profile config.
- Voice approvals and profile config edits by voice are deferred.
- Audio upload and playback state appear only after voice run records exist.
- Text fallback is always available.

### 2.6 Action Sheet

Use `DraggableScrollableSheet` for Telegram-like panels.

```text
+------------------------------------------------+
| Actions                                        |
+------------------------------------------------+
| New profile                                    |
| Tool approvals                                 |
| Workspace roots                                |
| Profile config                                 |
| Gateway details                                |
| Future file attach                             |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

Sheet rules:

- Snap between compact, half, and full height.
- Use the provided scroll controller so dragging and scrolling coordinate.
- Desktop gets a visible drag handle or side panel equivalent.
- Tokens and secret values never appear in sheet titles or route URLs.

### 2.7 Servers Screen

```text
+------------------------------------------------+
| Servers                                  [+]   |
+------------------------------------------------+
| local-gormes                                    |
| http://127.0.0.1:8765                           |
| Exposure: local    Auth: token required         |
| Health: OK         Stream: connected            |
| [Use] [Details]                                |
|                                                |
| tailnet-host                                    |
| http://100.64.1.2:8765                          |
| Exposure: tailscale   Auth: tailnet identity    |
| Health: offline                                |
| [Retry] [Details]                              |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

Server detail shows:

- Base URL.
- Health URL.
- Auth mode.
- Exposure mode.
- Token-required state.
- Last successful status.
- Last stream error.
- Redacted local credential status.
- Local trust for continuous voice.
- Capability summary: contacts, chat, voice input, schema config.

Continuous voice requires per-server local trust. The trust prompt shows safe
server identity/exposure/auth/capability evidence only.

### 2.8 Profile Editor

```text
+------------------------------------------------+
| Edit Profile                            [Save] |
+------------------------------------------------+
| Server: local-gormes                           |
| Profile ID: mineru                             |
| Display Name                                  |
| [ Mineru Builder                         ]     |
|                                                |
| Seed                                           |
| [ work on mineru repo                    ]     |
|                                                |
| Instructions                                   |
| [ concise coding assistant for this repo... ]  |
|                                                |
| Workspace Roots                                |
| mineru repo     repo       read-write    OK    |
| downloads       downloads  read-write    OK    |
| [Add Root]                                     |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

Profile creation starts with a short phrase and produces an editable draft:

- Server selection.
- Canonical profile id.
- Display name.
- Prompt/instructions.
- Provider/model draft, allowed to stay unset with a `model setup` attention
  badge.
- Tool set and permissions.
- Voice profile defaults for future server-side TTS/STT routing.
- Workspace root suggestions by label/purpose only; actual paths must be
  explicitly entered or confirmed.
- Safety and escalation notes.

Workspace root fields:

- `path`
- `label`
- `mode`: `read-only` or `read-write`
- `purpose`: `repo`, `downloads`, `docs`, `scratch`, or `other`
- server-returned health

Workspace root rules:

- Navivox sends add/remove/update requests; Gormes validates and persists.
- Gormes canonicalizes paths server-side and rejects dangerous or broad roots
  by policy.
- First version uses manual path entry plus server validation.
- Removing a root never deletes files.
- Applying root changes is blocked or deferred while the profile has active
  work, unless Gormes reports it is safe.
- A profile can exist with zero roots; filesystem tools remain disabled or
  setup-gated until roots exist.

| [Validate] [Apply]                             |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

Config rules:

- Secret values never render after entry.
- Diff shows non-secret before/after values.
- Server validation errors map to fields.
- Public exposure requires an explicit confirmation dialog.

### 2.11 Tool Call Card

```text
+-- execute_command ----------------------------+
| Status: completed                              |
| Duration: 0.3s                                 |

| [Inputs] [Output] [Artifacts]                  |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

Tool card states:

- queued
- running
- needs approval
- approved
- denied
- completed
- failed

Sensitive inputs and outputs are redacted by default with an explicit reveal
gate when the server allows it.

## 4. Status And Error States

| State | UI Treatment | Primary Action |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Gateway offline | Red status chip, setup error | Retry health check |
| Unauthorized | Amber status chip | Enter token |
| Exposure blocked | Red notice | Fix server config |
| Stream disconnected | Reconnecting banner | Retry or edit connection |
| Inbox full | Assistant/system error | Try again |
| Tool failed | Failed tool card | Expand details |
| Secret denied | Field error | Request admin role or unlock |
| Workspace issue | Profile row attention badge | Open workspace roots |
| Voice disabled | Disabled mic with reason | Enable continuous voice |
| Server untrusted | Trust banner/sheet | Review and trust server |

All error copy should point to a next action and avoid raw provider errors or
secret-shaped values.
