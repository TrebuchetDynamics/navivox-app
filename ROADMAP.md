# Hermes Wing Roadmap

Priority order. Each slice ships independently. Skip nothing above the line
until the line moves. This file tracks remaining work; the
[Hermes Desktop parity ledger](docs/product/hermes-desktop-parity.md) is the
canonical source for current capability status and evidence.

---

## Phase 1 — Ship the thing (close the gap with Wingman)

Users can't adopt what they can't install.

| # | Slice | Why now |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1.1 | **Signed release artifacts** — AAB for Play Store, APK for sideload, notarized DMG, MSIX, APT/DEB | No signed binaries = no users. Wingman ships APKs today. |
| 1.2 | **Full Agent configuration** — add/remove providers, switch models, manage skills, edit config.yaml, manage memory, manage cron, manage gateway platforms — all from the GUI. No CLI required. | The entire `hermes setup` surface lives in the app. This is the table stakes. |
| 1.3 | **Agent installer (optional)** — detect, download, install Hermes Agent locally on Termux Android, Linux, Windows. No remote installs. Only needed if Agent isn't already present. | Nice-to-have for new users. Configuration is mandatory; installation is not. |
| 1.4 | **LAN discovery** — mDNS/UDP broadcast or subnet scan for Hermes Agent port 8642 | Mobile users shouldn't type IPs. Wingman auto-scans for 9120. |
| 1.5 | **System tray** — minimize-to-tray on desktop, tray menu for quick actions | Desktop parity. Trivial with `tray_manager` or `system_tray`. |
| 1.6 | **CI release pipeline** — GitHub Actions build matrix: Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, web | Manual builds don't scale. One tag → all artifacts. |

## Phase 2 — Feature parity (match Wingman's surface area)

Close the remaining surface gaps by extending the current read-only foundations.
Keep them Agent-authoritative, not backend-duplicated.

| # | Slice | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|
| 2.1 | **Skills management** — add advertised enable/disable actions to the existing list and search UI | Keep `/v1/skills` authoritative. No client-side skill state. |
| 2.2 | **Memory browser** — list, search, delete memory entries | Paginated read from `/v1/memory`. Delete requires confirmation. |
| 2.3 | **Schedule management** — add create, edit, delete, and run-now actions to the existing read-only jobs UI | Show actions only when the Agent advertises them. |
| 2.4 | **File browser** — read/edit files in Hermes workspace | Uses Hermes resource handles, never raw client paths. |
| 2.5 | **Config editor** — syntax-highlighted YAML editor for config.yaml | Read via Agent API, write back through domain revision `If-Match`. |
| 2.6 | **Model presets** — save/load named model+config combos | Client-side only. Stored in `shared_preferences` or secure storage. |
| 2.7 | **Provider diagnostics** — extend existing credential validation and model inventory with a connection probe | Show latency plus model list or a bounded error. |
| 2.8 | **Logs viewer** — stream or tail Hermes Agent logs | If Agent exposes a log endpoint; otherwise skip until it does. |

## Phase 3 — Distribution and host integration

| # | Slice | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|
| 3.1 | **Web distribution** — publish the existing tested Flutter web build | Same codebase, zero new backend. |
| 3.2 | **Host adapter polish** — process lifecycle (start/stop/restart), auto-update Agent, health checks | Install is Phase 1. This is the ongoing management layer. Local only. |
| 3.3 | **iOS signed build** — TestFlight or App Store | Requires Apple Developer account + Xcode CI. |

## Phase 4 — Differentiate (things you have that Wingman doesn't)

Double down on your advantages.

| # | Slice | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|
| 4.1 | **Continuous voice hardening** — record a repeatable physical microphone receipt and harden the existing opt-in rearming loop | Keep transcript review and TTS failure recovery visible. |
| 4.2 | **Rich transcript polish** — finish selectable GFM markdown, code-copy controls, and link allowlisting | Build on the existing rich-text renderer. |
| 4.3 | **Adaptive Office depth** — extend the existing responsive 2D gateway workspace with an optional desktop 3D view | Preserve an accessible 2D equivalent. |
| 4.4 | **Approval UX polish** — refine the existing inline approve/deny cards and reason flow | Keep requests attached to their owning session. |
| 4.5 | **Diagnostics sharing** — add a native share action to the existing copyable bounded diagnostics | Never include credentials, transcripts, tool payloads, or local paths. |
| 4.6 | **Scoped token lifecycle** — add per-device labels, rotation, and revocation beyond enrollment | Security differentiator. Never render stored bearer values. |

## Phase 5 — Polish (make it feel finished)

| # | Slice | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|
| 5.1 | **Theme system** — 5-10 polished themes, dark/light default, user theme picker | Don't match Wingman's 29. Ship 5 good ones. |
| 5.2 | **Onboarding flow** — first-launch walkthrough, not just setup wizard | Context-aware tips, not a tutorial dump. |
| 5.3 | **Animations/transitions** — route transitions, loading states, skeleton screens | Flutter makes this cheap. Use it. |
| 5.4 | **Accessibility audit** — screen reader labels, contrast, keyboard nav | Per CONTEXT.md: "accessible equivalent" is a contract requirement. |
| 5.5 | **Localization** — full i18n for baseline locale set (12 locales per CONTEXT.md) | You have `l10n/` scaffolded. Fill it. |

## What's explicitly NOT on this roadmap

- **Backend server** — there is no backend. Hermes Wing never ships a backend.
  Hermes Agent IS the backend. The app manages it locally.
- **Remote Agent installs** — install target is local only: Termux Android,
  Linux, Windows. No SSH installs, no remote deployment. Also, the installer
  is optional — users may bring their own Agent.
- **Rails web dashboard** — Flutter web covers this. Second framework = second maintenance burden.
- **29 themes** — YAGNI. 5 good ones > 29 mediocre ones.
- **Client-side config parsing** — Agent owns config. Client reads advertised interfaces only.
- **Bundled Agent** — per CONTEXT.md: "It is not embedded in the Hermes Wing application package."
