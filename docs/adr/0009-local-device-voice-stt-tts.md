# ADR 0009: Use local device STT and TTS packages for voice

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

## Context

Hermes Wing voice is local to the client install. The app depends on `speech_to_text` for speech-to-text, `flutter_tts` for platform text-to-speech, and the pinned `pocket_speech` package for optional offline model inference. Hermes receives submitted text transcripts; it does not need client-recorded audio for the active workflow.

## Decision

Use local device packages for voice:

- `speech_to_text` captures user speech as a text transcript.
- The explicit microphone control submits the transcript immediately and
  speaks the completed Hermes reply once without re-arming capture.
- Continuous voice is a separate opt-in mode that submits the transcript,
  speaks the completed Hermes reply, and then re-arms capture.
- Recognition requests set `onDevice: true`; unsupported on-device recognition
  fails closed instead of silently using a network recognizer.
- `flutter_tts` speaks assistant replies when the platform supports it.
- `pocket_speech` runs the selected model entirely on device: Kitten nano-int8
  (about 26 MB) or Kokoro (about 365 MB including voices).
- Voice package support is platform-gated. Unsupported platforms return `null` providers and the UI pauses continuous voice with plain-language feedback.
- Do not log raw recognized speech text in diagnostics.
- Foreground lifecycle changes, switch-off, disconnects, and session changes
  cancel active capture and invalidate late results.
- Pocket Speech playback completion is observed before re-arming capture, and
  optional downloaded voice packs require HTTPS plus pinned SHA-256 digests.

## Consequences

- Server audio APIs remain out of scope until Hermes exposes stable mobile-safe endpoints.
- Tests use injectable engine interfaces and fake services rather than real microphones or speakers.
- Linux can still build the app. Platform TTS remains unavailable there, while Pocket Speech can run when a compatible voice pack is installed.

## Edge cases

- Unsupported platforms return `null` services and the UI pauses continuous voice instead of crashing.
- Blank captured transcripts fail locally before reaching Hermes.
- TTS ignores blank assistant text and retries configuration after a failed setup call.
- Speech diagnostics log metadata, not raw recognized words.
