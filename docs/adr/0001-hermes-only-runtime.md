# ADR 0001: Make Navivox a Hermes-only companion

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

## Context

`CONTEXT.md` defines Navivox as a Flutter companion for Hermes Agent and limits active routes to `/hermes` and `/settings`. `README.md` lists Hermes Agent HTTP endpoints as the runtime surface, and `docs/product/prd.md` names legacy gateway setup, profile-contact management, external memory dashboards, and server configuration editors as non-goals.

## Decision

Navivox targets Hermes Agent only. Product language, code, tests, docs, and routes should use Hermes endpoint, session, run, approval, tool progress, local voice, and local settings terminology.

Legacy Gormes/gateway/profile-contact/memory/config-admin surfaces are not part of the active app topology.

## Consequences

- The active route set stays small: `/hermes` and `/settings`.
- New work should not restore legacy gateway setup or Gormes-shaped abstractions unless a future ADR explicitly reopens that product scope.
- Documentation should be short and Hermes-only rather than carrying historical migration plans as current guidance.

## Evidence

- `CONTEXT.md:3-16`
- `README.md:3-24`
- `docs/product/prd.md:1-5`
- `docs/product/routes.md:3-6`
