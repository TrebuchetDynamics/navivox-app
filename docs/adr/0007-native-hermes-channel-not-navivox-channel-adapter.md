# ADR 0007: Keep a native HermesChannel instead of a legacy NavivoxChannel adapter

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

## Context

Navivox is now Hermes-only. The active Hermes API concepts are endpoints, sessions, runs, approvals, tool progress, stop controls, and local voice transcript submission. The previous Gormes-era `NavivoxChannel` shape included legacy profile, gateway, memory, and configuration concepts that are outside the active product scope.

## Decision

Do not implement Hermes as an adapter behind the legacy `NavivoxChannel` interface. Use `HermesChannel` as the public app seam for Hermes behavior, with `HermesApiChannel` as the production implementation. `HermesApiChannel` may be internally split by responsibility, but callers should continue to depend on `HermesChannel`.

## Consequences

- Hermes UI and tests are shaped around Hermes sessions and runs instead of relabeled Gormes concepts.
- The public seam remains small enough to test and override with fakes.
- Internal channel files can be refactored without changing UI imports or provider overrides.
- Reintroducing legacy channel compatibility requires a future ADR because it would broaden the product model.
