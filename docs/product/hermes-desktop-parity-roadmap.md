# Hermes Desktop parity roadmap

Status: active roadmap. Navivox stays a Hermes Agent mobile companion first; full
Hermes Desktop parity is a staged target, not a ship gate for the current chat
MVP.

Source docs:

- [Hermes Desktop architecture and feature research](../research/hermes-desktop-architecture-research.md)
- [Hermes Agent interface plan](hermes-agent-interface-plan.md)
- [Hermes companion readiness audit](../runbooks/hermes-readiness-audit.md)
- [Hermes platform smoke checklist](../runbooks/hermes-platform-smoke.md)
- [ADR 0007 — native Hermes channel](../adr/0007-native-hermes-channel-not-navivox-channel-adapter.md)

## Current baseline

Implemented in `main`:

- `/hermes` main route and `HermesChatScreen`.
- Hermes API connect/session/chat over `HermesApiChannel`.
- HTTP/SSE transport, session list/new/rename/delete/fork, text turns.
- Local STT transcript submission as Hermes text voice, with capability-strip,
  diagnostics, mic, and continuous-voice copy stating device STT becomes Hermes
  text and server audio is not used yet.
- Approvals, stop, tool-progress UI, read-only jobs inventory, bounded diagnostics.
- Fake/live/provider browser smoke helpers.
- Published `Hermes platform smoke` workflow with watched current-head
  Windows/iOS/macOS native-host job and artifact receipts.
- Multi-endpoint/profile management with non-secret profile metadata/base URLs in
  shared preferences and per-profile API keys in secure storage.

Current readiness blockers:

- Hermes realtime/server audio unimplemented.
- Deferred Desktop-like surfaces: config/admin editing, memory UI, jobs/schedules
  admin, messaging gateways, persona/SOUL editing, attachments/media,
  files/context folders, and raw logs export.
- Remaining polish/hardening needs only when new regressions or uncovered edge
  cases are found; current SSE/drop, offline/auth-expired, session
  search/grouping, queued follow-up, and mobile approval/error/session sheet
  paths have focused coverage.

## Roadmap rules

1. Do not promote proxy evidence. Tests, APK hashes, workflow YAML, configured
   Hermes home, and dispatch-only workflow output are not readiness receipts.
2. Prefer hidden/read-only over half-wired admin UI when Hermes does not expose a
   safe API contract.
3. Every surface needs: capability detection, empty/offline/error states,
   redaction rules, tests, and a rollback/hide path.
4. Mutation surfaces need more: explicit Hermes API support, bearer-auth policy,
   confirmation UX for destructive actions, audit/redaction rules, and recovery
   copy.
5. Keep local STT voice useful while server/realtime audio remains separate and
   explicitly deferred.

## Phase 0 — receipt and release blocker closeout

Goal: make the existing chat companion evidence shippable without expanding
scope.

Work:

- Keep `.github/workflows/hermes-platform-smoke.yml` published as
  `Hermes platform smoke`.
- Keep `build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json` refreshed from a watched
  current-head run with successful Windows, macOS, and iOS simulator
  job/artifact receipts.
- Keep provider-backed smoke current with configured model/provider credentials.
- Keep `build/receipts/android-hermes-voice-loop-smoke.json` refreshed from
  `npm run android:hermes-voice-loop-smoke` for no-human Android voice-loop
  mechanics; it must not be described as physical microphone evidence.

Acceptance gate:

- `NAVIVOX_FAIL_ON_BLOCKERS=1 npm run hermes:readiness-audit` has no external
  receipt blockers for provider smoke, automated Android voice-loop mechanics,
  native hosts, or platform workflow publication.
- The runbooks contain concrete command/job/artifact receipts, not just planned
  commands. As of this update, provider smoke plus platform workflow/native-host
  receipts are covered; automated Android voice-loop receipt covers only
  deterministic no-human UI loop mechanics and still does not claim physical mic
  coverage. The manual physical-mic ship gate remains open until the real
  spoken-audio/provider/TTS/re-arm receipt is captured.

Rollback/hide behavior:

- If a receipt is missing, keep the readiness audit blocking and keep docs using
  `NOT COMPLETE` language.

## Phase 1 — chat companion hardening

Goal: make the implemented `/hermes` surface reliable under bad networks and
normal mobile use.

Work:

- Harden SSE reconnect/failure behavior: dropped stream, partial message,
  duplicate completion, late tool event, approval timeout, stop failure.
- Reconcile streamed transcript with session history after completion.
- Improve offline and auth-expired states for saved endpoint/API key.
- Keep bounded diagnostics copyable without raw logs, secrets, transcripts, or
  tool payloads.
- Preserve accessibility for session drawer, approval prompts, stop, voice, and
  error banners.

Acceptance gate:

- Focused `HermesApiChannel`/SSE tests cover stream edge cases.
- Browser fake Hermes smoke still passes.
- Provider text + deterministic transcript voice smoke passes when credentials
  are available.

Rollback/hide behavior:

- On unsupported capabilities or repeated transport failures, fall back to safe
  session-chat behavior or show recovery copy; do not expose broken run controls.

## Phase 2 — mobile voice receipts and audio strategy

Goal: finish mobile voice-path confidence before starting server audio without
requiring a human speaker in the strict readiness loop.

Work:

- Keep automated Android deterministic transcript → Hermes text turn → fake TTS
  → re-arm receipt current through `npm run android:hermes-voice-loop-smoke`.
- Keep provider transcript voice smoke current to prove model/provider replies for
  the transcript path.
- Keep UI copy clear that local STT is the active voice path and that automated
  voice-loop receipts are not physical microphone evidence.
- Keep the manual live-mic runbook available as optional hardware/audio evidence
  when an audio-capable target exists.
- Draft Hermes realtime/server audio API requirements only after Hermes exposes a
  documented API and Navivox has tests against it.

Acceptance gate:

- `build/receipts/android-hermes-voice-loop-smoke.json` matches current `HEAD`
  and validates deterministic Android voice-loop mechanics.
- Provider smoke validates typed text plus deterministic transcript voice against
  configured model/provider credentials.
- Readiness audit no longer blocks on a human-spoken Android microphone receipt,
  and it explicitly refuses to call automated receipts physical mic evidence.
- Server/realtime audio remains deferred unless Hermes exposes a documented API
  and Navivox has tests against it.

Rollback/hide behavior:

- If device STT or audio target is unavailable, voice controls show unavailable
  state and keep text chat usable. If the automated Android receipt is missing or
  stale, strict readiness blocks without asking for a human speaker.

## Phase 3 — read-only Desktop parity surfaces

Goal: expose useful Desktop-like context without mutation risk.

Candidate surfaces:

- Models/providers: current selected model/provider and capability health.
- Skills/toolsets: enabled inventory from Hermes API.
- Jobs/schedules: read-only job inventory includes enabled/state/schedule/next/last/error details with secret redaction; admin remains deferred.
- Health/capabilities: clearer endpoint readiness and version details.
- Bounded diagnostics: richer counts/statuses, still no raw logs or payloads.

Acceptance gate:

- Each surface is capability-gated and hidden or empty-state safe when absent.
- No secrets, transcript content, raw tool payloads, or private paths in UI/export.
- Widget/browser tests cover available, absent, loading, and error states.

Rollback/hide behavior:

- Missing capability means hidden/read-only-empty, not fake data or stale Gormes
  concepts.

## Phase 4 — admin surfaces, split by risk

Goal: add mutation only when Hermes has explicit safe APIs and Navivox has guard
rails.

Order:

1. Jobs/schedules admin: create/edit/delete with confirmations and dry-run where
   Hermes supports it.
2. Config/model/provider editing: only behind explicit Hermes config APIs;
   never edit files by guessing paths.
3. Memory UI: read/list/search before write/delete; mutation requires redaction
   and confirmation rules.
4. Persona/SOUL: only through explicit API or safe CLI/file contract.
5. Messaging gateways: status first, admin later; never expose provider secrets.
6. Attachments/media and files/context folders: require mobile-safe picker,
   upload limits, permission copy, and retention rules.
7. Raw logs/diagnostics export: last; requires redaction contract and explicit
   user action.

Acceptance gate for every mutation surface:

- Hermes capability advertises the endpoint and operation.
- Auth/authorization failure is safe and recoverable.
- Destructive actions require confirmation.
- Tests prove secret/path/transcript redaction.
- Surface can be disabled remotely by capability absence.

Rollback/hide behavior:

- Any failed contract or missing capability hides mutation UI while preserving
  read-only status where safe.

## Phase 5 — multi-endpoint/profile management

Status: local profile management implemented for the Hermes connect flow.
`SecureHermesEndpointStore` stores non-secret endpoint profile metadata/base URLs
in shared preferences and keeps per-profile API keys in secure storage. The
connect form renders saved profile chips that can select or forget an endpoint.

Remaining work:

- Remote revoke/status reporting if Hermes adds a revoke API.
- Optional explicit label editing beyond the current saved-profile metadata.
- Per-endpoint session cache boundaries if Navivox later caches server sessions
  locally.
- Keep old Gormes Profile contacts out of Hermes terminology.

Acceptance gate:

- API keys remain in secure storage only.
- Switching endpoints cannot leak sessions, diagnostics, or secrets across
  endpoint boundaries.
- Forget endpoint removes local key/metadata and reports remote revoke status
  only when a remote revoke API exists.

Rollback/hide behavior:

- If endpoint identity is ambiguous, keep profile chips hidden and show setup
  copy.

## Phase 6 — Desktop parity review gate

Goal: decide whether Navivox should pursue parity surface-by-surface or remain a
focused companion.

Gate checklist:

- Phase 0 receipts are green and current.
- Chat/voice companion usage is stable under real Android and provider runs.
- Every read-only/admin surface has explicit Hermes API backing.
- Security review covers secrets, logs, transcripts, tool payloads, files, and
  destructive actions.
- UX review confirms mobile value; Desktop-only install/update/office workflows
  may remain out of scope.

Outcome options:

- Promote a surface to MVP if it has mobile value and passes its gate.
- Keep it read-only if mutation risk is higher than mobile value.
- Keep it deferred if Hermes lacks API support or safe mobile semantics.
