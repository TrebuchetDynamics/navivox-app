## Objective

Run technical-auditor Full mode for the current Pi working directory (`.`), then execute an autonomous improvement loop until all safe audit recommendations are fixed, deferred with reason, or blocked with an owner decision.

Preflight before audit:
- Capture git status and classify dirty-file ownership before relying on worktree evidence.
- Read repo instructions and package/project manifests.
- Identify the package/project test command and run the relevant baseline when feasible.
- Check codebase map freshness when codebase-map-understand.md is present; treat it as leads only.

Controller contract:
- Use technical_auditor_checkpoint for every preflight, audit, finding, validation, re-audit, and finalization transition.
- Work on one finding at a time. Do not begin another finding until the controller accepts the current finding outcome.
- Treat checkpoint rejection as authoritative workflow state and follow the returned next action.
- Do not call goal_complete directly. The controller permits completion only after final validation and delivery succeed.

Mega automation contract:
1. Load and follow /skill:technical-auditor in Full mode. No mode argument means Full mode: broad audit plus architecture-deepening review.
2. Study repo instructions, dirty worktree, manifests, CI/tests, and existing codebase maps such as codebase-map-understand.md when present. Treat generated map facts as leads and verify live files.
3. Produce the required audit evidence and inline architecture candidates before changing production code, unless a tiny safety-net/test change is needed to validate the audit path.
4. Convert every safe recommendation in the audit Task Plan into implementation slices. Do not stop after only the top recommendation. Start with Milestone 0 safety nets, then critical correctness/security, then high-impact architecture/testability improvements, then polish.
5. For design-bearing refactors, pause for grill-with-docs before editing production code so terms, seams, and ADR-sensitive decisions are settled.
6. Implement only safe, in-scope, validated changes. Do not publish, deploy, spend money, rewrite history, force-push, expose secrets, or overwrite unrelated dirty work.
7. After each slice, run the most relevant validation commands plus package/project validation when feasible. Record evidence, then pick the next remaining safe recommendation.
8. After the current audit's safe recommendations are fixed/deferred/blocked, rerun technical-auditor Full mode on the same scope and continue the loop for newly discovered safe recommendations.
9. Continue autonomously while safe useful recommendations remain. If blocked by ownership, risky product behavior, legal/security uncertainty, or failing validation you cannot fix safely, stop with a clear blocker and next action.
10. Before marking the goal complete, perform the technical-auditor completion audit: every audit recommendation from every pass is fixed with validation, explicitly deferred with reason, or blocked with owner decision needed; no unverified completion claims.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Status | Title | Evidence | Commit / stash |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M0-1 | High | fixed | Restore failing baseline: flutter test --coverage --concurrency=1 | Baseline command exited 1 | 14567eec4d85447e767c952d276049845a488fb1 |
| F-002 | Medium | blocked | Contain gateway directory startup and refresh failures | lib/features/hermes_chat/gateways/hermes_gateway_directory.dart:122-182 marks startup/refresh state before unguarded cache/store operations; lines 427-442 discard periodic/resume refresh futures. | stash@{0} |
| F-003 | Medium | pending | Gate signed alpha publishing on repository validation | .github/workflows/release-alpha.yml:14-117 builds and publishes after compilation only; docs/runbooks/release-alpha.md:21-23 leaves format/analyze/test/audit validation as an unenforced operator instruction. | — |
| F-004 | Low | pending | Remove stale transient validation metrics from readiness documentation | docs/runbooks/hermes-readiness-audit.md:54,83 claims a current 543-test 73.07% pass; live baseline ran 427 passing cases plus one failure and measured 73.90%. | — |
| F-005 | Medium | pending | Dependency review is knowingly red on every pull request | docs/runbooks/hermes-readiness-audit.md:16-18 records that GitHub dependency review is unsupported because the repository dependency graph is disabled while the PR workflow still runs the job. | — |
| A-002 | Medium | pending | Deepen the Hermes transport seam | lib/core/hermes/client/hermes_api_client.dart:22-49 exposes seven verb callbacks; lib/core/hermes/client/hermes_api_transport.dart:1-74 mirrors those functions; 141 test constructors repeat transport wiring across real IO, web, stub, and fake adapters. | — |
| A-003 | Medium | pending | Move chat workflow state behind a deep in-process coordinator | lib/features/hermes_chat/screens/hermes_chat_screen.dart and nine part files share 20+ mutable fields across more than 4,000 lines; those exact files are active owner work excluded from this audit implementation. | — |
