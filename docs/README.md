# Navivox Documentation

Start with `../CONTEXT.md` for stable product language, then use this index to find the durable docs. Current `main` is Hermes Agent-first; Gormes pages and early ADRs are preserved as legacy/historical context unless they explicitly say they are active.

## Testing And Historical Implementation Notes

- [Playwright E2E guide](../playwright/README.md) — current browser test inventory, including deterministic Hermes fake smoke and env-gated live/provider specs.
- [Superpowers plans/specs](superpowers/) — historical implementation packets; use them as record, not as current Hermes-first readiness source.

## Runbooks And Handoffs

Before any Hermes readiness completion claim, run strict readiness audit:

```bash
NAVIVOX_FAIL_ON_BLOCKERS=1 npm run hermes:readiness-audit
```

While external/deferred blockers remain, the expected result is exit 3 with
`Completion verdict: NOT COMPLETE`; do not treat proxy evidence such as passing
tests, APK hashes, configured Hermes home, workflow YAML, or dispatch-only output
as completion. Current delivery note: `.github/workflows/hermes-platform-smoke.yml`
is published as `Hermes platform smoke`. `npm run platform:workflow-smoke`
dispatches and watches the workflow, then writes
`build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json` with current-head
Windows/iOS/macOS native-host job and artifact evidence. Workflow YAML or
dispatch-only output remains insufficient without that watched receipt.
