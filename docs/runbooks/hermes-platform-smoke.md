# Hermes platform smoke checklist

Use this checklist for the native Hermes Agent UI. It separates build-only gates
from live-device gates so we do not claim mobile/desktop parity from widget tests
alone.

## Build gates

Run from the repo root:

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test --concurrency=1
flutter build web --release -t lib/main_e2e.dart
flutter build apk --debug
npm run linux:release-build
```

Current local receipts (refreshed through 2026-07-03):

- `flutter analyze` — pass.
- `flutter test --concurrency=1` — pass, 1016 tests.
- `flutter build web --release -t lib/main_e2e.dart` — pass.
- `flutter build apk --debug` — pass, artifact at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk` with SHA-256 `453e746d9773b466a7393ec73713943a49276f4bee4465d18a3d083e5cb5ab0a` (artifact identity only; not live Android or mic evidence).
- `cd android && ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` — pass for Navivox app native Android unit tests. The broader `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` runs third-party plugin tests too and currently fails in `image_picker_android`'s `ImagePickerDelegateTest` in this environment.
- `npm run linux:release-build` — pass, artifact at
  `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/navivox`. This container has no passwordless
  `sudo`, so `libsecret-1-dev`/`libgcrypt20-dev`/`libgpg-error-dev` (required
  by `flutter_secure_storage_linux`'s `pkg_check_modules(... libsecret-1 ...)`)
  can't be `apt-get install`ed system-wide. Root-less recipe used instead:
  1. `apt-get download libsecret-1-dev libgcrypt20-dev libgpg-error-dev`
     (download only, no root needed) and `dpkg -x <pkg>.deb <prefix>` each
     into a local prefix directory.
  2. Copy the `.pc` files from `<prefix>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/`
     into a separate directory, rewriting `prefix=/usr` to
     `prefix=<prefix>/usr` in each (the extracted `.pc` files still point at
     the system `/usr` by default).
  3. Fix the dev package's `libsecret-1.so -> libsecret-1.so.0` symlink,
     which is dangling inside the extracted prefix (the versioned `.so.0` is
     only installed system-wide by the already-present runtime package,
     `libsecret-1-0`) — repoint it at the real system file:
     `ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsecret-1.so.0 <prefix>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsecret-1.so`.
  4. `rm -rf build/linux` (force a clean CMake configure — a cached
     `CMakeCache.txt` from an earlier failed attempt will otherwise keep a
     stale `pkgcfg_lib_LIBSECRET_secret-1-NOTFOUND` `find_library` result
     even after the symlink is fixed) and rerun `flutter build linux` with
     `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` pointing at the rewritten `.pc` directory and `CPATH`
     pointing at `<prefix>/usr/include`. The helper script
     `scripts/run_linux_release_build.sh` automates this fallback and is exposed
     as `npm run linux:release-build`.
  The resulting binary links the real system `libsecret-1.so.0` at runtime
  (confirmed via `ldd`) — the local prefix is a build-time-only stand-in for
  the missing dev headers/symlink, not something the shipped binary depends
  on. The helper accepts a relative or absolute `NAVIVOX_LINUX_BUILD_DEPS_DIR`
  and resolves it before rewriting `.pc` files so nested CMake builds can still
  find the extracted headers/libs. This recipe is only needed in root-less
  containers; CI/normal dev machines should just `apt-get install
  libsecret-1-dev`.
- `flutter build windows --debug` — blocked here because Flutter only supports
  this command on Windows hosts (`"build windows" only supported on Windows
  hosts.`; latest local reprobe exited 1 on 2026-07-03).
- `flutter build ios` — blocked here because this Linux Flutter toolchain does
  not expose usable iOS simulator build options (`flutter build ios --simulator
  --debug` exits 64 with `Could not find an option named "--simulator".`);
  validate on macOS/Xcode.
- `flutter build macos` — blocked here because this Linux Flutter toolchain does
  not expose a macOS build subcommand (`flutter build macos` exits 64 with
  `Could not find a subcommand named "macos" for "flutter build".`); validate
  on `macos-latest` or a local Mac.

Windows, iOS, and macOS platform folders are present. The iOS `Info.plist`
includes microphone and speech-recognition usage descriptions for the Hermes
voice-to-text path. Windows, iOS, and macOS builds must run on their host
platforms/CI runners; they are not validated from this Linux container.

Host-runner CI is defined in `.github/workflows/hermes-platform-smoke.yml` with
bounded job timeouts so unavailable hosts/emulators fail with actionable logs
instead of hanging:

- Ubuntu: analyze, tests, web e2e build, fake Hermes browser smoke, Android
  debug APK build, Linux release build, and uploaded Android/Linux artifacts.
- Windows: Flutter Windows debug build on `windows-latest` plus uploaded debug
  bundle artifact.
- macOS/iOS: Flutter iOS simulator debug build and Flutter macOS desktop debug
  build on `macos-latest`, with uploaded simulator and macOS app artifacts.
- Manual `workflow_dispatch`: optional provider-backed Hermes web smoke when
  `run_provider_smoke` is enabled and `provider_url` is supplied. Store the API
  key in the `NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_HERMES_API_KEY` repository secret.
- Manual `workflow_dispatch`: optional Android emulator integration smoke when
  `run_android_emulator_smoke` is enabled. It runs the speech-readiness,
  deterministic Hermes continuous-voice loop, and durable-key integration tests
  on a GitHub-hosted Android emulator through the same hardened `scripts/run_android_*`
  wrappers used locally.

The workflow file must be visible to GitHub before this counts as a receipt.
A local YAML file is not enough, and dispatch-only output is not enough. The
workflow is now published remotely as `Hermes platform smoke`; the source of
truth is the refreshed current-head
`build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json`, which records the watched GitHub
run id plus successful Windows desktop, iOS simulator, and macOS desktop
native-host jobs/artifact metadata. Earlier local-only YAML and
missing-`workflow`-scope push failures are historical non-receipts, not current
blockers.

Dispatch and watch the host-runner receipt path with:

```bash
npm run platform:workflow-smoke
```

When `NAVIVOX_WATCH_WORKFLOW=true` (default) and the watched run succeeds, the
helper writes `build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json` with the GitHub run
URL, conclusion, commit, required native artifact names, artifact metadata, and
native job metadata. If a required native artifact is missing, expired, empty,
or lacks a download URL, or if a required Windows/iOS/macOS native job is not
`completed`/`success`, the helper exits 5 and the receipt is marked failed. The
readiness audit validates that receipt, including `run_status: completed`,
non-expired/non-empty artifact metadata, successful native job metadata, and
matching the receipt `head_sha` to the current git `HEAD`, before treating
Windows/iOS/macOS native-host artifacts as recorded. If `NAVIVOX_WATCH_WORKFLOW=false` is used, the helper only proves
dispatch; it does not wait for job results and writes no receipt. If dispatch
succeeds but no run id is visible, the helper exits 4 and still does not count as
a platform receipt. Collect successful Windows/iOS/macOS/Android/Linux job
receipts from `gh run view`/artifact logs before claiming platform readiness.

Before any completion claim, run the readiness audit in strict mode:

```bash
NAVIVOX_FAIL_ON_BLOCKERS=1 npm run hermes:readiness-audit
```

While blockers remain, the helper must exit 3 and print
`Completion verdict: NOT COMPLETE`. Do not promote proxy evidence such as tests,
APK hashes, configured Hermes home, workflow YAML, or dispatch-only output to
platform readiness.

Optional knobs:

```bash
NAVIVOX_RUN_ANDROID_EMULATOR_SMOKE=true npm run platform:workflow-smoke
NAVIVOX_RUN_PROVIDER_SMOKE=true \
NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_HERMES_URL=https://hermes.example \
npm run platform:workflow-smoke
```

The provider smoke still requires the `NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_HERMES_API_KEY`
repository secret. If workflow pushes are blocked by credential scope, validate
these gates manually on equivalent host runners until the workflow can be
published.

## Browser e2e Hermes smoke

```bash
flutter build web --release -t lib/main_e2e.dart
node serve_web.mjs &
npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.mjs playwright/tests/regression/hermes-smoke.spec.mjs --reporter=list
```

The e2e server provides a local Hermes HTTP/SSE fake so the browser test uses
real `HermesApiChannel` web transport for health, capabilities, sessions, runs,
run events, approvals, tool progress, and stop/approval endpoints.

Current receipts:

- 2026-07-01: `hermes-smoke.spec.mjs` passed 2 Chromium tests, covering
  disconnected setup hints plus connected text, new-session, voice-transcript,
  approval, stop, and tool-progress UI.
- 2026-07-03: focused regression rerun of `navivox-e2e.spec.mjs` plus
  `hermes-smoke.spec.mjs` passed 68 Chromium tests with:
  `npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.mjs playwright/tests/regression/navivox-e2e.spec.mjs playwright/tests/regression/hermes-smoke.spec.mjs --reporter=list`.
  The broad `npm run web:e2e` wrapper timed out in this environment, so use the
  focused command as the current browser receipt until the wrapper timeout is
  revalidated.

## Live Hermes Agent smoke

A local installed Hermes Agent API connect smoke is automated:

```bash
npm run hermes:live-smoke
```

The script starts `hermes gateway` with a generated test API key, isolated temp
`HERMES_HOME`, API server enabled, and CORS for the local Navivox web bundle. It
then builds `lib/main_e2e.dart`, serves the Flutter web bundle, and runs
`playwright/tests/regression/hermes-live-api.spec.mjs` against the live Hermes
API. It verifies `/hermes` can connect to the installed Hermes API and render the
session surface without using provider/model credentials.

Override knobs when needed:

```bash
NAVIVOX_LIVE_HERMES_PORT=8642 npm run hermes:live-smoke
NAVIVOX_LIVE_HERMES_HOME=/path/to/test-home npm run hermes:live-smoke
```

Current receipt (refreshed 2026-07-03): installed `hermes` v0.16.0 was present on PATH;
`npm run hermes:live-smoke` passed against a temp-home API server on loopback.
This proves API connect/session rendering only; it is not provider/model evidence,
not a chat/voice provider smoke, not physical microphone evidence, and not
whole-goal completion evidence by itself. The helper points operators back to
strict readiness audit before any completion claim.

Provider-backed web chat plus transcript-voice validation is gated because it
needs a Hermes endpoint already configured with real model/provider credentials:

```bash
NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_HERMES_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642 \
NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_HERMES_API_KEY=... \
npm run hermes:provider-smoke
```

If the installed local Hermes home is already configured with provider/model
credentials, this helper starts the API server with a temporary Navivox test API
key and runs the same provider smoke:

```bash
NAVIVOX_CONFIGURED_HERMES_HOME=$HOME/.hermes npm run hermes:provider-smoke:local
```

The provider smoke builds `lib/main_e2e.dart`, serves the Flutter web bundle,
connects to the supplied Hermes endpoint, sends a typed prompt, then submits a
simulated device voice transcript through `HermesApiChannel`. It expects the
assistant to include `NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK` and
`NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_VOICE_OK` by default; override the prompt/expected text with
`NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_TEXT_PROMPT`, `NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_TEXT_EXPECTED`,
`NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_VOICE_PROMPT`, and `NAVIVOX_PROVIDER_VOICE_EXPECTED` for a
specific provider/model. It intentionally does not test a physical microphone;
that remains the Android device-gated smoke below.

Current receipt (refreshed 2026-07-03):
`npm run hermes:provider-smoke:local` passed against the installed local Hermes
server and configured provider/model credentials (Playwright reported 1 pass).
This is still transcript voice, not physical microphone or Hermes server audio,
and not whole-goal completion evidence by itself. The helper points operators
back to strict readiness audit before any completion claim.

Full live chat/voice validation still requires, for Android microphone capture,
a responsive device/emulator:

1. Start Hermes Agent API server on `127.0.0.1:8642` with test credentials.
2. Open Navivox `/hermes` on web/desktop or Android.
3. Connect using the platform-appropriate URL:
   - desktop/Linux/Windows/iOS simulator: `http://127.0.0.1:8642`
   - Android emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:8642`
   - physical device: LAN/VPN/Tailscale URL
4. Verify: session list/create, typed text turn, streamed assistant response,
   tool progress card, approval prompt + response, stop, reconnect from saved
   endpoint, push-to-talk voice transcript, and continuous voice loop.

## Android live smoke (still required)

A debug APK builds locally, but no responsive Android device/emulator was
available in this environment. The automated readiness gate is:

```bash
npm run android:voice-smoke
```

or, for a specific target:

```bash
NAVIVOX_ANDROID_DEVICE_ID=<device-id> npm run android:voice-smoke
```

The script grants `RECORD_AUDIO` when possible and runs
`integration_test/android_device_speech_smoke_test.dart`, which verifies the
native Android speech diagnostics MethodChannel reports at least one speech
recognition service and microphone permission granted. This is a readiness gate,
not a substitute for listening to real microphone input, and not whole-goal
completion evidence by itself. The helper points operators back to strict
readiness audit before any completion claim.

Current receipt (2026-07-02): the bundled `fractal_test` emulator had to be
launched headlessly with software rendering:

```bash
/usr/lib/android-sdk/emulator/emulator -avd fractal_test -no-window -no-audio -no-snapshot -gpu swiftshader_indirect -accel off
```

After boot completed, `npm run android:voice-smoke` passed. Earlier attempts
could also observe the emulator while it was still `offline`; the Android smoke
scripts now wait up to `NAVIVOX_ANDROID_DEVICE_WAIT_SECONDS` for Flutter to list
an Android target before selecting one. Install attempts also timed out while
Android framework services were still stabilizing, so the scripts require
repeated readiness checks for `sys.boot_completed=1`, `service check package`,
and `service check settings` before installing/running tests on slow
software-emulated runners. They also require `cmd package list packages` to
succeed because `service check package` can briefly report `found` while package
commands still fail. The scripts retry once when Flutter/ADB reports an Android
install/start flake such as a missing package service, broken pipe, or offline
device.

A deterministic Android Hermes voice-loop smoke, still without physical audio,
can exercise the Flutter continuous-voice loop on device:

```bash
npm run android:hermes-voice-loop-smoke
```

or, for a specific target:

```bash
NAVIVOX_ANDROID_DEVICE_ID=<device-id> npm run android:hermes-voice-loop-smoke
```

It runs `integration_test/hermes_continuous_voice_android_smoke_test.dart` with
a deterministic transcript capture service and fake Hermes channel. Passing this
means the Android Flutter UI can perform capture → submit transcript → assistant
reply/TTS → re-arm. It still does not prove physical microphone audio input.

Current receipt (refreshed 2026-07-03): after KVM-backed `fractal_test`
emulator boot stabilized, `NAVIVOX_ANDROID_DEVICE_ID=<emulator>
NAVIVOX_ANDROID_DEVICE_WAIT_SECONDS=1 npm run android:hermes-voice-loop-smoke`
passed. This refresh proves deterministic Android UI loop mechanics only; it is
not physical microphone evidence, not a provider-backed reply receipt, not
Hermes realtime/server audio, and not whole-goal completion evidence by itself.
The helper points operators back to strict readiness audit before any completion
claim.

Perform the manual live Hermes Agent voice smoke on an audio-capable target before any active-goal completion claim.
Use [`android/live-mic-smoke.md`](android/live-mic-smoke.md) as the canonical
required physical-audio receipt checklist. To install the debug APK, grant
microphone permission, and launch Navivox on an audio-capable Android target,
run:

```bash
npm run android:live-mic-prep
```

Optional knobs:

```bash
NAVIVOX_ANDROID_DEVICE_ID=<device-id> \
NAVIVOX_ANDROID_HERMES_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8642 \
npm run android:live-mic-prep
```

Current prep receipt (2026-07-03): after KVM-backed `fractal_test` emulator
boot stabilized, `NAVIVOX_ANDROID_DEVICE_ID=<emulator>
NAVIVOX_ANDROID_DEVICE_WAIT_SECONDS=1 NAVIVOX_ANDROID_SKIP_BUILD=1
NAVIVOX_ANDROID_HERMES_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8642 npm run android:live-mic-prep`
installed/launched/granted microphone permission. This prep command is not a
pass receipt and not whole-goal completion evidence by itself. The helper points
operators back to strict readiness audit before any completion claim. The strict
automated Android gate is `npm run android:hermes-voice-loop-smoke`, which writes
`build/receipts/android-hermes-voice-loop-smoke.json` and must not be described
as physical microphone evidence. Required physical-mic evidence still requires:

1. Connect to Hermes using `http://10.0.2.2:8642` for emulator or a LAN/VPN URL
   for a physical device.
2. Tap Speak and confirm a spoken phrase submits as a Hermes text turn.
3. Enable continuous voice and confirm capture → assistant reply/TTS → re-arm.
4. Confirm no API key or transcript secret appears in routes, logs, notices, or
   diagnostics export.

## Legacy durable-key smoke

`npm run android:durable-key-smoke` remains available for preserved legacy code,
but it is not part of the active pure-Hermes readiness gate. Do not treat legacy
keypair or reconnect tests as blockers for the Hermes companion release. The
active automated Android gate is the deterministic Hermes voice-loop receipt;
required physical-mic evidence is tracked separately by the live-mic runbook.
