# Hermes companion readiness audit

Last updated: 2026-07-04.

This audit maps the current pure-Hermes Navivox companion goal to concrete
evidence and remaining blockers. It is intentionally conservative: a passing
test only counts for the behavior it directly exercises. For a quick read-only
local snapshot, run `npm run hermes:readiness-audit`; that helper prints every
explicit external or deferred blocker but is not a completion receipt.

## Success criteria and evidence

| Requirement | Current evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider-backed Hermes chat smoke with real model/provider credentials | `npm run hermes:provider-smoke:local` passed on 2026-07-03 with a configured local Hermes home; Playwright reported 1 pass. The smoke connects to a configured local Hermes API, sends a typed prompt, and verifies the model reply. The helper says this receipt is not whole-goal completion evidence by itself and points to strict readiness audit before completion claims. | Covered for configured local Hermes text. |
| Provider-backed Hermes voice smoke | Same provider smoke submits a deterministic device transcript via `navivoxE2EHermesSubmitVoice` and verifies a model reply. The helper caveat says this is deterministic transcript voice only, not physical microphone evidence or Hermes realtime/server audio. | Covered for transcript voice only; not physical mic or server audio. |
| Android speech/mic readiness | `npm run android:voice-smoke` passed on a KVM-backed `fractal_test` emulator on 2026-07-03, verifying speech recognizer availability and granted mic permission. `NAVIVOX_ANDROID_SKIP_BUILD=1 NAVIVOX_ANDROID_HERMES_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8642 npm run android:live-mic-prep` also installed/launched/granted mic permission on `fractal_test`. A later direct target recheck showed `adb devices` had no attached Android devices while `flutter devices` listed only Linux desktop and Chrome web. The canonical manual physical-audio checklist is `docs/runbooks/android/live-mic-smoke.md`. | Readiness/prep covered; real spoken audio not covered. |
| Android continuous voice loop | `NAVIVOX_ANDROID_DEVICE_ID=<emulator> NAVIVOX_ANDROID_DEVICE_WAIT_SECONDS=1 npm run android:hermes-voice-loop-smoke` passed on a KVM-backed `fractal_test` emulator on 2026-07-03. It runs `HermesChatScreen` with deterministic capture, fake Hermes channel, and fake TTS for two loop turns. | Deterministic loop covered; physical mic/provider loop not covered. |
| Android debug APK build | `flutter build apk --debug` passed on 2026-07-03 and produced `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk` with SHA-256 `453e746d9773b466a7393ec73713943a49276f4bee4465d18a3d083e5cb5ab0a`. App-scoped native units also passed with `cd android && ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`. | Covered locally for build/native units and artifact identity only; no live Android physical mic receipt. |
| Linux release build | `npm run linux:release-build` passed on 2026-07-03 and produced executable `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/navivox`. | Covered locally. |
| Windows build | `build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json` records watched run `28715961684`/later current-head reruns with a successful `Windows desktop build` job and non-expired `navivox-windows-debug-bundle` artifact. | Covered by hosted native-runner receipt. |
| iOS simulator build | `build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json` records a successful `iOS simulator build` job and non-expired `navivox-ios-simulator-app` artifact. | Covered by hosted native-runner receipt. |
| macOS desktop build | `build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json` records a successful `macOS desktop build` job and non-expired `navivox-macos-debug-app` artifact. | Covered by hosted native-runner receipt. |
| Browser fake Hermes smoke | Focused Playwright regression rerun of `navivox-e2e.spec.mjs` plus `hermes-smoke.spec.mjs` passed on 2026-07-03 against `node serve_web.mjs` with 68 Chromium tests after a longer-timeout rerun; the focused Hermes smoke itself passed 2 Chromium tests and covers fake Hermes health/capabilities/sessions/runs/events/approvals/tool progress/stop. | Covered for fake server. |
| Installed Hermes API connect smoke | `npm run hermes:live-smoke` passed on 2026-07-03 against installed local Hermes with isolated temp home and no provider credentials; Playwright reported 1 pass. The helper caveat says this is API connect/session rendering only, not provider/model evidence, not chat/voice provider smoke, not physical microphone evidence, and not whole-goal completion evidence by itself. | Covered for live connect/session surface. |
| Deferred server realtime audio honesty | `lib/core/hermes/policy/hermes_surface_readiness.dart` marks advertised-but-unwired server realtime voice/audio as blocked and unadvertised server audio as deferred; README states voice is local-first. | Covered by code/docs. |
| Deferred config admin honesty | Surface readiness marks config editing/admin as `deferred`. | Covered by code/docs. |
| Deferred memory UI honesty | Hermes surface readiness marks Memory UI as `deferred`. | Covered by code/docs. |
| Jobs/schedules | `GET /api/jobs` is implemented as read-only inventory; surface readiness separates jobs/schedules inventory (`readOnly`) from jobs/schedules admin (`deferred`). | Read-only inventory covered; admin deferred. |
| Messaging gateways, persona/SOUL, attachments, files/context folders | Surface readiness marks each as deferred with explicit copy. | Covered as deferred, not implemented. |
| Diagnostics/log export | Bounded diagnostics export exists and excludes secrets/raw logs; surface readiness separately marks raw diagnostics/log export as `deferred`. The diagnostics test seeds transcript and raw tool-payload content and asserts the export reports only counts/statuses. | Bounded diagnostics covered; raw logs/payloads deferred. |
| Multi-endpoint/profile management | `HermesEndpointStore`/`SecureHermesEndpointStore` now support saved endpoint profiles; the connect form renders selectable/deletable profile chips and keeps per-profile API keys in secure storage. | Covered locally. |
| Secret hygiene for Hermes diagnostics | `test/features/hermes_chat/screens/hermes_chat_screen_test.dart` asserts diagnostics include `Secrets: excluded` and omit `Authorization`, fake transcript tokens, and raw tool payload markers. | Covered for diagnostics export. |
| Overall Dart/widget regression | `flutter test --concurrency=1` passed on 2026-07-03 with 1016 tests after the latest diagnostics, workflow, docs, and readiness-guard changes. | Covered locally, but does not replace device/host receipts. |
| Static analysis | `flutter analyze` passed with no issues after the readiness audit/docs/test guard changes and again after the closeout status refreshes. | Covered locally. |
| E2E web release build | `flutter build web --release -t lib/main_e2e.dart` passed after the closeout status refreshes and produced `build/web`. | Covered locally for web build only. |
| CI receipt path robustness | `.github/workflows/hermes-platform-smoke.yml` is published and visible as `Hermes platform smoke`. `npm run platform:workflow-smoke` dispatches, watches, and writes `build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json`; the receipt validates current `HEAD`, successful run conclusion, required native jobs, and non-empty non-expired native artifacts. | Covered for platform/native-host receipt. |

## Open blockers

1. **Real Android spoken microphone continuous loop** — requires an audio-capable
   responsive Android device/emulator. Current Android receipts use either native
   readiness diagnostics or deterministic transcript capture; a KVM-backed
   `fractal_test` refresh passed `npm run android:voice-smoke`, but that still
   proves recognizer/permission readiness only, not spoken audio, provider reply,
   TTS, or continuous re-arm. A later target recheck found no attached Android
   device in `adb devices`; Flutter listed only Linux desktop and Chrome web.
2. **Hermes server realtime audio** — not implemented in Navivox; voice remains
   local STT-to-text.
3. **Deferred product surfaces** — config editing/admin, Hermes memory UI,
   jobs/schedules admin, messaging gateways, persona/SOUL, attachments/media,
   files/context folders, and raw log export remain outside the implemented
   Hermes mobile MVP. Multi-endpoint/profile management is now implemented
   locally.
4. **Polish/hardening** — SSE reconnect/drop edge cases, offline/auth-expired UX,
   session search/grouping, queued follow-ups, and mobile approval/error/session
   sheet polish remain improvement work after the core receipt blockers.

## Current completion audit verdict

The active Hermes companion goal is **not complete**. Current evidence maps to
the explicit objective as follows:

| Objective item | Concrete artifact/evidence inspected | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real Android spoken mic receipt | `adb devices` currently has no attached Android device; earlier `fractal_test` receipts are readiness/prep/deterministic only. | Blocked: no current Android target for manual spoken-audio closeout. |
| Windows/iOS/macOS host receipts | `build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json` validates successful watched native-host jobs and artifacts for the current checkout. | Covered. |
| Publish platform workflow | `gh workflow list` exposes `Hermes platform smoke`, and `npm run platform:workflow-smoke` produced a successful watched receipt. | Covered. |
| Hermes realtime/server audio | `hermesSurfaceReadiness()` marks server realtime voice/audio as deferred; voice remains local STT-to-text. | Deferred/unimplemented by policy. |
| Deferred Hermes Desktop parity | Multi-endpoint/profile management is available locally; jobs inventory and bounded diagnostics are read-only; config/admin, memory UI, jobs admin, gateways, persona/SOUL, attachments/media, files/context folders, and raw diagnostics/log export are deferred. | Partially covered; remaining surfaces deferred/read-only by policy. |
| Polish/hardening | Existing tests cover the implemented happy paths and selected edge cases, but the roadmap still calls out SSE reconnect/drop, offline/auth-expired UX, session search/grouping, queued follow-ups, and mobile approval/error/session sheet polish. | Not complete. |

Do not promote this audit, green tests, APK hashes, configured Hermes home
presence, workflow YAML, or dispatch-only workflow output to completion evidence
unless the missing live/provider/device/native-host receipts above are captured.

## Current blocker detail

The read-only helper currently expands the remaining blockers into these
non-overlapping categories:

- Provider-backed smoke receipt: configured Hermes home presence is only
  informational. Strict closeout still requires a current
  `npm run hermes:provider-smoke:local` receipt with configured model/provider
  credentials, and deterministic transcript voice still is not physical
  microphone or Hermes server-audio evidence.
- Native/host receipts: platform workflow publication and Windows/iOS/macOS
  hosted receipts are covered by `build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json`;
  no online Android target remains the external device blocker. When Android is
  missing, the helper prints `flutter devices`, `flutter emulators`, and
  `emulator -accel-check` output as blocker context only, not Android/audio or
  live-mic receipt evidence.
- Voice/audio: real Android spoken microphone loop missing; Hermes
  realtime/server audio not implemented, so voice remains local STT-to-text.
- Deferred Hermes surfaces: config editing/admin, memory UI, jobs/schedules
  admin, messaging gateways, persona/SOUL, attachments/media, files/context
  folders, and raw diagnostics/log export. Multi-endpoint/profile management is
  implemented locally with secure per-profile API-key storage.
- Polish/hardening: SSE reconnect/drop edge cases, offline/auth-expired UX,
  session search/grouping, queued follow-ups, and mobile approval/error/session
  sheet polish.

## Do not count as completion

- Android `voice-smoke` by itself: it proves recognizer/mic permission readiness,
  not spoken audio capture.
- Android `live-mic-prep` by itself: it installs/launches/grants permission and
  prints a checklist; it is not a spoken-audio receipt.
- Deterministic Android voice-loop smoke by itself: it proves UI loop mechanics,
  not physical microphone input.
- Installed-Hermes live connect smoke by itself: it proves API connect/session
  rendering against an isolated or configured API server, not provider/model
  behavior, chat/voice provider smoke, or physical microphone evidence.
- Provider transcript voice by itself: it proves device-transcript-to-Hermes text
  flow with a model reply, not microphone or Hermes realtime audio.
- Configured Hermes home presence by itself: it suggests a local provider smoke
  may be runnable, but only an actual `npm run hermes:provider-smoke:local`
  receipt proves provider-backed chat/transcript voice.
- Workflow YAML by itself: it proves a planned CI path, not a native-host build
  receipt, even when the YAML parses and has timeouts/artifact uploads.
- Workflow dispatch by itself: `NAVIVOX_WATCH_WORKFLOW=false` proves only that
  dispatch was requested; a missing visible run id or unwatched run is not a
  platform receipt. Only a watched successful run with required artifacts and the
  validated `build/receipts/hermes-platform-workflow.json` receipt can satisfy
  the workflow/native-host portion. Collect successful job status and artifacts
  with `gh run view` before claiming Windows/iOS/macOS/Android/Linux readiness.
